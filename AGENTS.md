# AGENTS.md â€” Start Here (AI Coding Agents)

Welcome! Before making any changes or running tests, read the project guide below. It contains required conventions, architecture notes, and workflows used in this repo.

Primary guide (must read):
- examples/cs2d/docs/CLAUDE.md

Notes for agents:
- Treat the above file as the source of truth for development flow.
- If instructions in other docs conflict, defer to CLAUDE.md.
- After reading, apply the guidance to testing (SPA-first E2E), server ports, and coding style.

If the path changes, search for "CLAUDE.md" in the repo and follow its latest location.
