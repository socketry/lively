# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Lively is a Ruby framework for building interactive web applications for creative coding. It provides real-time communication between client and server using WebSockets through the Live gem, and runs on the Falcon web server.

## Key Commands

### Dependencies
```bash
# Install Ruby dependencies
bundle install

# Install Node dependencies (for client-side Live.js)
npm install
```

### Running Applications
```bash
# Run the main application
bundle exec lively lib/lively/application.rb

# Run examples (from example directory)
cd examples/hello-world
bundle exec lively application.rb

# Alternative: use the lively executable directly
./bin/lively examples/hello-world/application.rb
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests with Sus test framework
bundle exec sus

# Run a specific test file
bundle exec sus test/lively.rb
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Run RuboCop for linting
bundle exec rubocop

# Run RuboCop with auto-fix
bundle exec rubocop -a
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

**Lively::Application** (`lib/lively/application.rb`)
- Base class for Lively applications, extends `Protocol::HTTP::Middleware`
- Handles WebSocket connections at `/live` endpoint
- Factory method `Application[ViewClass]` creates application instances for specific view classes
- Manages Live::Page instances for real-time updates

**Live::View Pattern**
- Views inherit from `Live::View` and implement `render(builder)` method
- Views bind to pages and can trigger updates with `update!`
- Builder provides HTML generation methods

**Asset Pipeline** (`lib/lively/assets.rb`)
- Serves static files from `public/` directories
- Client-side JavaScript components in `public/_components/`
- Includes morphdom for DOM diffing and @socketry/live for WebSocket handling

### Application Structure

```
application.rb    # Defines Application class with View
gems.rb          # Dependencies (points to main gem)
public/          # Static assets
  _static/       # CSS, images, audio files
```

### WebSocket Communication
- Live updates happen through WebSocket connections to `/live`
- Live::Page manages the connection between server views and client DOM
- Uses Live::Resolver to control which classes can be instantiated on the client

### Running Examples
Each example is self-contained with its own `application.rb` that:
1. Defines view classes extending `Live::View`
2. Creates an Application using `Lively::Application[ViewClass]`
3. Can be run with `bundle exec lively application.rb`

## Key Patterns

### Creating a New Application
```ruby
class MyView < Live::View
  def render(builder)
    # Build HTML using builder methods
  end
end

Application = Lively::Application[MyView]
```

### View Updates
Views can trigger client updates by calling `update!` which sends the new rendered HTML over the WebSocket connection.

### Static Asset Organization
- Application-specific assets go in `./public/_static/`
- Shared framework assets are in the gem's `public/` directory
- Both are automatically served by the Assets middleware
