### Live Framework Integration

#### WebSocket Communication Pattern
```ruby
# Server → Client (using Live framework)
self.script(<<~JAVASCRIPT)
  window.GameEngine.updateState(#{state.to_json});
JAVASCRIPT

# Client → Server (using event forwarding)
def handle(event)
  case event[:type]
  when "player_move"
    process_movement(event[:detail])
  end
end
```

#### View Update Pattern
```ruby
class GameView < Live::View
  def bind(page)
    super
    @page = page
    self.update!  # Initial render
  end
  
  def render(builder)
    # Build HTML with builder DSL
    builder.tag(:div, id: "game") do
      builder.text("Game content")
    end
  end
end
```

### Redis Architecture (Async-Redis)

#### Key Features
- **Thread-safe operations**: Async context management
- **TTL management**: Automatic cleanup (rooms: 1hr, players: 5min)
- **Atomic operations**: Pipeline for consistency
- **Pub/sub messaging**: Real-time room updates

#### Redis Schema
```
Keys:
- room:{room_id}:data         # Room metadata (JSON)
- room:{room_id}:players      # Hash of player IDs
- player:{player_id}:room     # Current room assignment
- active_rooms                # Set of all room IDs
```

#### Async-Redis API Differences
```ruby
# WRONG - Standard redis gem syntax
redis.set("key", "value", ex: 3600)

# CORRECT - Async-redis syntax
redis.setex("key", 3600, "value")
```

---

## 💻 Development Workflow

### Coding Standards

**RuboCop Enforcement**
```bash
# Check code quality
bundle exec rubocop

# Auto-fix issues
bundle exec rubocop -a

# Required standards:
- Tabs for indentation
- Double quotes for strings
- Snake_case for methods
- CamelCase for classes
```

### JavaScript Best Practices

#### Large Script Management
```ruby
# For scripts >10K characters, externalize to files
def render_javascript_integration(builder)
  # Use explicit closing tags (critical!)
  builder.tag(:script, src: "/_static/game.js") do
    # Empty block forces proper HTML tags
  end
  
  # Dynamic initialization
  builder.tag(:script) do
    builder.raw(<<~JS)
      window.GameEngine?.initialize('#{@player_id}');
    JS
  end
end
```

#### Common Pitfalls
- ❌ Never use `builder.text()` for JavaScript (escapes as HTML)
- ✅ Always use `builder.raw()` for script content
- ❌ Avoid self-closing script tags `<script />`
- ✅ Use explicit opening/closing tags

### i18n Implementation

#### Translation Structure
```ruby
# lib/i18n.rb usage
I18n.t("lobby.title")                    # Simple key
I18n.t("lobby.messages.room_created",    # With interpolation
       room_id: "abc123")
I18n.locale = :en                        # Switch language
```

#### Adding New Languages
1. Add translations to `lib/i18n.rb`
2. Update `available_locales` array
3. Add to `locale_name` method
4. UI automatically includes new option

### Cookie-Based Player ID Persistence

#### Implementation Overview
- **Storage**: Browser cookies with 30-day expiry
- **Format**: `cs2d_player_id=<uuid>`
- **Initialization**: Checks cookie on page load, generates UUID if none exists
- **UI**: Edit button in header with modal dialog
- **Validation**: Non-empty, max 50 characters

#### Key Implementation Files
- `async_redis_lobby_i18n.rb`: Main implementation
  - `initialize_player_from_cookie()`: Client-side cookie check
  - `handle_change_player_id()`: Server-side ID update
  - `set_player_cookie()`: JavaScript cookie setter
- `lib/i18n.rb`: Translations for player ID UI

#### Modal Close Methods
1. Click "Save" button (儲存)
2. Press Enter in input field
3. Click "Cancel" button (取消)
4. Click modal background
5. Press ESC key

#### Cookie Persistence Flow
1. **First Visit**: Generates new UUID, stores in cookie
2. **Return Visit**: Reads cookie, restores player ID
3. **Manual Edit**: Updates both UI and cookie
4. **Room Operations**: Uses persistent ID for all operations

### Testing with Playwright

**IMPORTANT**: When making frontend changes, always test with Playwright browser MCP tools. Default testing should use Playwright, not manual browser testing.

#### Available Test Scripts

```bash
# Test room creation and creator identification
node test_lobby.js

# Test full game flow (lobby → room → game)
node test_full_game_flow.js

# Test multiplayer game directly
node test_multiplayer_game.js

# Debug specific issues
node test_debug.js
node test_button.js
node test_hidden_field.js
```

#### Basic Playwright Test Pattern

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

async function test() {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  
  // Monitor console
  page.on('console', msg => console.log(msg.text()));
  
  await page.goto('http://localhost:9292');
  
  // IMPORTANT: Use specific selectors to avoid ambiguity
  // Wrong: await page.click('button:has-text("創建房間")'); // Matches 2 buttons!
  // Right: await page.click('#create-form button:has-text("創建房間")');
  
  await browser.close();
}
```

#### Testing with Playwright MCP Tools

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the lobby
mcp__browser__playwright_navigate url="http://localhost:9292" headless=false

# 2. Take initial screenshot
mcp__browser__playwright_screenshot name="initial-lobby" fullPage=true

# 3. Test room creation (use specific selector!)
mcp__browser__playwright_fill selector="#room_name" value="Test Room"
mcp__browser__playwright_select selector="#max_players" value="4"
mcp__browser__playwright_click selector="#create-form button:has-text('創建房間')"

# 4. Verify room creation
mcp__browser__playwright_screenshot name="after-create" fullPage=true

# 5. Check console logs for errors
mcp__browser__playwright_console_logs type="error"
```

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "unknown keyword: :ex" Error
**Cause**: Using standard redis gem syntax with async-redis
**Solution**: Use `setex(key, ttl, value)` instead of `set(key, value, ex: ttl)`

### Issue: Black Screen / JavaScript Not Loading
**Cause**: Invalid self-closing script tags or escaped JavaScript
**Solutions**:
```ruby
# Always use explicit closing tags
builder.tag(:script, src: "file.js") do
  # Empty block required
end

# Use raw() for JavaScript content
builder.tag(:script) do
  builder.raw(javascript_code)  # Not text()
end
```

### Issue: Falcon Multi-threading Race Conditions
**Cause**: In-memory state not thread-safe across Falcon processes
**Solution**: Use Redis for shared state management

### Issue: WebSocket Timing Problems
**Cause**: JavaScript executes before WebSocket connection ready
**Solution**: Add initialization delay or connection checks
```ruby
Async do
  sleep 1.5  # Wait for WebSocket
  inject_javascript
end
```

---

## 🚢 Production Deployment

### Redis Configuration
```bash
# Development
redis-server  # Default localhost:6379

# Production checklist
- [ ] Enable persistence (RDB/AOF)
- [ ] Configure memory limits
- [ ] Set up Redis Sentinel/Cluster
- [ ] Monitor with Redis INFO
```

### Performance Optimization
- **State delta compression**: ~80% bandwidth reduction
- **Message batching**: Group updates in 50ms windows
- **Asset caching**: External JS files with long TTL
- **Connection pooling**: Reuse WebSocket connections

### Monitoring
```ruby
# Add to room manager
def get_metrics
  {
    rooms: @@room_manager.get_stats,
    memory: `ps -o rss= -p #{Process.pid}`.to_i,
    connections: @page ? 1 : 0
  }
end
```

### Scaling Considerations
- Each room: max 10 players
- Each process: ~50 concurrent rooms
- Redis memory: ~10KB per active room
- Network: ~5KB/s per active player

## 🎯 Development Guidelines

### When Working on This Project
1. **Use application.rb**: Always ensure Application class is defined only in application.rb
2. **Check Redis**: Ensure Redis is running for multiplayer features
3. **Run RuboCop**: All Ruby code must pass linting
4. **Test Changes**: Use Playwright MCP for comprehensive UI testing (mandatory for frontend changes)
5. **Update i18n**: Add translations for new UI elements
6. **Document**: Update this file for significant changes
7. **Verify Notifications**: Test user feedback system after any changes

### Key Principles
- **Server Authority**: Never trust client for game logic
- **Async First**: Use Async blocks for I/O operations
- **Fail Gracefully**: Always handle errors with user feedback
- **Test Coverage**: Write Playwright tests for new features
- **Performance**: Monitor and optimize hot paths
