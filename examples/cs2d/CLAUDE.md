# CS2D - TypeScript Counter-Strike 2D Game

## Project Overview

CS2D is a fully functional browser-based 2D reimplementation of Counter-Strike featuring authentic CS 1.6 audio, intelligent bot AI, modern UI/UX, and comprehensive game systems. Built with TypeScript, React, and cutting-edge web technologies for optimal performance and user experience.

**Current Status: âœ… Production Ready** - All core systems functional with stable 121 FPS performance.

## Architecture

### Core Systems

#### 1. GameCore Engine (`src/game/GameCore.ts`)
- Main game loop and entity management
- Physics simulation and collision detection
- Player and bot AI management
- Weapon system integration
- State synchronization for multiplayer

Key features:
- 121+ FPS game loop with delta time compensation
- Entity Component System (ECS) pattern for game objects
- Authentic CS 1.6 movement physics
- Surface-based movement sounds
- Stable round system with automatic progression
- Comprehensive economy system (money rewards: $2400-$3250)
- Real-time scoring and statistics tracking

#### 2. CS 1.6 Authentic Audio System (`src/game/audio/`)
- **CS16AudioManager**: Main audio controller with 3D positional audio
- **CS16SoundPreloader**: Async sound loading with intelligent 3-tier fallback system
  - Primary: 464 authentic CS 1.6 sounds from `/cstrike/sound/`
  - Fallback: Categorized generic sounds from `/sounds/fallback/`
  - Ultimate: Basic UI click sound for guaranteed audio feedback
- **CS16BotVoiceSystem**: Bot personality-based voice lines and radio commands
- **CS16AmbientSystem**: Dynamic ambient sounds based on map location

Sound categories with fallback support:
- Weapon sounds (fire, reload, empty clip) â†’ generic weapon sounds
- Player sounds (footsteps, damage, death) â†’ generic step/hit sounds
- Radio commands (Z/X/C menus) â†’ radio static fallback
- Ambient map sounds â†’ ambient nature/urban fallbacks
- UI feedback sounds â†’ click/hover/success/error sounds

#### 3. Multiplayer State Management

##### GameStateManager (`src/game/GameStateManager.ts`)
- Network event synchronization
- State snapshot creation and application
- Event throttling for performance
- Audio event broadcasting
- Offline/online mode switching

Network events handled:
- `player_move`, `weapon_fire`, `weapon_reload`
- `player_damage`, `player_death`
- `radio_command`, `footstep`
- `bomb_plant`, `bomb_defuse`
- `round_start`, `round_end`

##### WebSocketGameBridge (`src/game/WebSocketGameBridge.ts`)
- Bridges GameCore with WebSocket multiplayer
- Room management (join/leave/create)
- Host/client architecture
- Event throttling (20 events/sec per type)
- Positional audio synchronization

Configuration:
```typescript
{
  enableVoiceChat: true,
  enablePositionalAudio: true,
  maxPlayersPerRoom: 10,
  tickRate: 64
}
```

### Frontend Architecture

#### React Components (`frontend/src/components/`)
- **EnhancedModernLobby**: Main game lobby with modern UI/UX
  - Multi-layered animated gradient backgrounds
  - Floating gradient orbs with staggered animations
  - Interactive hover effects (scale, glow, shadows)
  - Audio toggle with visual feedback
  - Advanced loading states with skeleton screens
- **GameCanvas**: Game rendering and HUD overlay
- **EnhancedWaitingRoom**: Pre-game room management
- **LanguageSwitcher**: i18n support

#### Context Providers (`frontend/src/contexts/`)
- **AppContext**: Global app state
- **AuthContext**: Player authentication
- **WebSocketContext**: Real-time communication
- **GameContext**: Game state management
- **I18nContext**: Internationalization

## Common Issues & Solutions

### âœ… Recently Fixed Issues

### Issue: FPS showing as 0
**Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - FPS now displays correctly at 121+ FPS
**Solution Applied**: Initialized `fpsUpdateTime` properly in GameCore constructor

### Issue: Audio path duplication ("/cstrike/sound//cstrike/sound/")
**Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - Audio files now load correctly
**Solution Applied**: Added path normalization in CS16SoundPreloader to prevent double base path

### Issue: Start Game button not working
**Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - Navigation works smoothly
**Solution Applied**: Simplified button implementation using direct window.location.href navigation

### Issue: Double game initialization in React StrictMode
**Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - Game initializes once and runs stably
**Solution Applied**: Added initialization guard in GameCanvas useEffect

### Issue: Shooting and hit detection not working
**Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - Players can now shoot and eliminate enemies
**Solution Applied**: Fixed weapon ID mismatches in weapon system, repaired collision detection between projectiles and bots

### ðŸ”§ Current Known Issues

### Issue: Some radio command audio files missing
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ **MINOR** - Game functional but some sounds fall back to generic
**Workaround**: Audio fallback system provides alternative sounds

### Issue: WebSocket connection errors in offline mode
**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ **EXPECTED** - This is normal behavior
**Solution**: These errors are expected in offline mode and don't affect gameplay

### ðŸ’¡ Performance & Optimization

### Current Performance Metrics:
- **FPS**: 121+ (excellent)
- **Memory**: Efficient audio caching with 50MB limit
- **Load Time**: Fast startup with intelligent sound preloading
- **Responsiveness**: Real-time input handling and bot AI

### Issue: Poor performance
**Current Status**: Game runs at optimal 121 FPS
**If performance issues occur**:
1. Check FPS counter (should be 100+ FPS)
2. Reduce number of bots if needed
3. Check browser dev tools Performance tab
