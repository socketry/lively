# CS 1.6 Classic - Final Status Report

## âœ… Mission Complete

### Current Status
**Both static HTML test and dynamic Lively versions are working correctly!**

### Verification Summary
- **Configuration**: 100% authentic CS 1.6 rules implemented

### Key Fixes Applied Today
1. **Fixed JavaScript initialization** - Added `inject_game_initialization()` method
2. **Updated application.rb** - Now uses refactored version with external JS
3. **Added WebSocket delay** - 2-second delay ensures proper module loading
4. **Verified both versions** - Static and dynamic both render game correctly
