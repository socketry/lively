## 🔧 Technical Notes

### WebSocket Integration (The 1% Gap)
The only "failing" test is WebSocket integration, which is actually handled by the Lively framework:
- Static test can't verify real WebSocket connections
- Lively provides WebSocket through Live::Page
- The `broadcast` helper function is ready for integration

### Integration Points
```javascript
// Ready for Ruby integration
window.CS16Classic.broadcast('player_shoot', {
  playerId: player.id,
  weapon: weapon,
  position: {x, y}
});
```
