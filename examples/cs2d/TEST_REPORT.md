```

## Recommended Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Bundle JavaScript files** - Reduce script count from 20+ to optimize loading
2. **Fix game object initialization** - Ensure consistent initialization across all pages
3. **Optimize rapid input handling** - Reduce processing time for high-frequency inputs

### Medium Priority
1. **Remove duplicate canvas elements** - Single canvas for better performance
2. **Implement proper error boundaries** - Better error handling in React components
3. **Add performance monitoring** - Real-time FPS and memory tracking

### Low Priority
1. **Enhance test coverage** - Add more edge cases
2. **Implement visual regression testing** - Screenshot comparisons
3. **Add load testing** - Test with multiple concurrent users

## Test Infrastructure

### Tools Used
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe test implementation
- **Docker**: Containerized test environment
- **Vite**: Frontend development server

### Test Categories
1. **Functional Tests**: Core game mechanics
2. **Performance Tests**: FPS, memory, load times
3. **Integration Tests**: WebSocket, multiplayer
4. **Regression Tests**: Error handling, stability
