# CS2D Static Server Health Check Fix

## Problem Summary

The CS2D static server container was consistently showing as "unhealthy" in Docker despite the server running and serving files correctly. The health check failures were preventing proper service monitoring and orchestration.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Incorrect Health Check Target

- **Problem**: The Dockerfile health check was attempting to access `/map_editor.html`
- **Reality**: The file exists at `/_static/map_editor.html` (in the `_static` subdirectory)
- **Impact**: Health check was failing with 404 errors every 30 seconds

### Issue 2: Document Root Path Problem

- **Problem**: Static server was setting document root to `File.join(__dir__, 'public')`
- **Container Reality**: `__dir__` pointed to `/app/src/servers`, so it looked for `/app/src/servers/public`
- **Actual Location**: Files were mounted at `/app/public`
- **Impact**: Server was unable to serve files from the correct location

### Issue 3: No Dedicated Health Endpoint

- **Problem**: Using actual file serving for health checks is fragile
- **Impact**: Health checks dependent on specific file existence rather than server health

### Issue 4: Insufficient Logging and Error Handling

- **Problem**: Limited diagnostic information when failures occurred
- **Impact**: Difficult to debug issues in production environment

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Fixed Document Root Path

```ruby
# Before (incorrect)
@document_root = File.join(__dir__, 'public')
# Result: /app/src/servers/public (doesn't exist)

# After (fixed)
@document_root = File.expand_path('../../public', __dir__)
# Result: /app/public (correct location)
```

### 2. Added Dedicated Health Endpoint

Created a proper `/health` endpoint that returns comprehensive server status:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "server": "CS2D Static Server",
  "port": 9293,
  "document_root": "/app/public",
  "document_root_exists": true,
  "uptime": 3600,
  "available_files": ["/game.html", "/room.html", "/_static/map_editor.html"]
}
```

### 3. Updated Docker Health Check

```dockerfile
# Before (fragile)
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:9293/map_editor.html || exit 1

# After (robust)
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=10s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:9293/health || exit 1
```

### 4. Enhanced Logging and Error Handling

- Added startup validation to check document root existence
- Enhanced request logging for debugging
- Added error handling for file serving operations
- Created comprehensive health status reporting

## Testing and Validation

### Diagnostic Script

Created `/scripts/test_static_health.rb` to validate:

- Basic server connectivity
- Health endpoint functionality
- File serving capabilities
- CORS header configuration

### Usage

```bash
# Test local server
ruby scripts/test_static_health.rb

# Test remote server
ruby scripts/test_static_health.rb hostname 9293
```

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Rebuild and Restart Container

```bash
# Stop current container
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml stop static-server

# Rebuild with fixes
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml build static-server

# Start with new configuration
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d static-server
```

### 2. Verify Health Status

```bash
# Check container health
docker ps --filter name=cs2d-static

# Test health endpoint directly
curl http://localhost:9293/health

# Run comprehensive diagnostics
ruby scripts/test_static_health.rb
```

## Production Considerations

### Health Check Timing

- **Start Period**: Increased to 10s to allow for Ruby startup
- **Timeout**: Increased to 10s for reliable responses
- **Interval**: 30s provides good monitoring without overhead
- **Retries**: 3 attempts before marking unhealthy

### Monitoring Integration

The health endpoint provides structured data for:

- Container orchestration (Docker Swarm, Kubernetes)
- Load balancers (HAProxy, Nginx)
- Monitoring systems (Prometheus, DataDog)

### Security

- Health endpoint includes no sensitive information
- CORS headers properly configured for cross-origin access
- File serving remains restricted to document root

## Performance Impact

### Before Fix

- Health checks failing every 30s generating error logs
- No insight into actual server status
- Manual debugging required for issues

### After Fix

- Clean health checks with structured status
- Comprehensive diagnostic information
- Proactive issue detection and resolution

## Future Enhancements

1. **Metrics Collection**: Add request counters and timing to health endpoint
2. **Dependency Checks**: Validate Redis connectivity if needed
3. **Cache Status**: Include file cache information
4. **Resource Usage**: Add memory and CPU usage to health data

## Conclusion

The static server health check issues were caused by incorrect file paths and missing health infrastructure. The fix provides:

- ✅ **Reliable Health Monitoring**: Dedicated endpoint with comprehensive status
- ✅ **Proper File Serving**: Correct document root resolution
- ✅ **Enhanced Debugging**: Detailed logging and error handling
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Robust health checks for orchestration
- ✅ **Diagnostic Tools**: Automated testing and validation

The static server now operates as a production-ready microservice with proper health monitoring and diagnostic capabilities.
