### 🏛️ Agent 5: Architecture Analysis

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Agent Type**: General Purpose

**Deliverables**:

- ✅ Analysis of **6 different architectural attempts**
- ✅ Root cause analysis for each failure
- ✅ Salvageable components inventory
- ✅ Lessons learned documentation
- ✅ Recommendations for v0.2

**Key Findings**:

1. **unified_spa_view.rb**: Failed due to no render protection
2. **fixed_unified_spa.rb**: Basic throttling insufficient
3. **enhanced_lobby_progressive.rb**: DOM manipulation workaround
4. **async_redis_lobby_i18n.rb**: Working but limited scope
5. **Emergency Patch System**: SUCCESSFUL comprehensive solution
6. **routed_application.rb**: Not true SPA, service separation

**Salvageable Components**:

- **High Value**: i18n system, room management, render manager
- **Medium Value**: Routing patterns, event forwarding
- **Low Value**: Complex view switching, manual throttling

**Impact**: Avoid repeating past mistakes
