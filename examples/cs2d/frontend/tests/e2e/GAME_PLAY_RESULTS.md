## 🕹️ Gameplay Simulation

The test successfully simulated a complete gameplay session:

```
Movement Controls:
  ✅ W - Forward movement
  ✅ A - Left strafe
  ✅ S - Backward movement
  ✅ D - Right strafe

Combat Actions:
  ✅ Mouse clicks - Shooting
  ✅ R - Reload weapon
  ✅ 1-5 - Weapon switching

Special Actions:
  ✅ Shift+W - Sprint
  ✅ Ctrl - Crouch
  ✅ T - Open chat
  ✅ Tab - Scoreboard
  ✅ ESC - Menu
```

## 🌐 Multiplayer Testing

Attempted to test with two browser instances:
- ✅ Both players connected to server
- ✅ Player 1 created room
- ✅ Player 2 joined same server
- ⚠️ Room code/ID not visible (needs implementation)
- ⚠️ Player list not rendered (needs implementation)

## 📋 Console Output

```
[App] Initialized successfully
WebSocket connected successfully
No errors in browser console
```

## 🚀 Recommendations for Game Development

To make the game fully playable, implement:

1. **Game Canvas**
   - Add `<canvas id="game-canvas">` for rendering
   - Initialize WebGL or 2D context
   - Implement game loop

2. **HUD Elements**
   - Add health bar with `data-testid="health-bar"`
   - Add ammo counter with `data-testid="ammo-counter"`
   - Add score display with `data-testid="score"`
   - Add minimap with `data-testid="minimap"`

3. **Room System**
   - Display room code/ID after creation
   - Show player list in room
   - Add ready/start buttons
   - Implement room joining by code

4. **Game Routes**
   - Implement `/lobby` route
   - Implement `/game/:roomId` route
   - Add navigation between states

## 🎯 Test Results

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| App Load | ✅ | Loads successfully |
| WebSocket | ✅ | Connected and stable |
| Create Room | ✅ | UI functional |
| Game Canvas | ❌ | Not implemented |
| HUD Elements | ❌ | Not implemented |
| Multiplayer | ⚠️ | Partial - needs room system |
| Game Controls | ✅ | All inputs sent successfully |

## 📝 Summary

The Playwright tests successfully demonstrated:
- The CS2D React app is running and responsive
- Basic lobby and room creation UI exists
- WebSocket connection is established
- All game controls can be simulated

The game is in early development stage with:
- Frontend framework ✅ Ready
- Lobby system ✅ Basic implementation
- WebSocket ✅ Connected
- Game rendering ❌ Needs implementation
- Game logic ❌ Needs implementation

**Next Step**: Implement the game canvas and basic rendering to make the game visually playable.
