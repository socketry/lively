## üéØ Environment Variables

Set these environment variables for testing:

```bash
# Test user credentials
TEST_USERNAME=testplayer
TEST_PASSWORD=testpass123
TEST_PLAYER_NAME=TestPlayer

# Test server
TEST_API_URL=http://localhost:9294/api
TEST_WS_URL=ws://localhost:9292

# Test configuration
TEST_HEADLESS=false  # Run with visible browser
TEST_SLOW_MO=100     # Slow down actions by 100ms
TEST_TIMEOUT=60000   # Test timeout in ms
```

## üêõ Debugging Failed Tests

### View Test Artifacts
After running tests, artifacts are saved in:
- `test-results/` - Test results and traces
- `tests/e2e/screenshots/` - Screenshots
- `tests/e2e/recordings/` - Video recordings

### Use Trace Viewer
```bash
# View trace for failed test
npx playwright show-trace test-results/[test-name]/trace.zip
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### WebSocket Connection Fails
- Ensure backend servers are running
- Check WebSocket URL in environment variables
- Verify no firewall blocking WebSocket connections

#### Game Doesn't Load
- Check if static server is serving game files
- Verify Canvas/WebGL support in test browser
- Increase timeout for game load

#### Multiplayer Sync Issues
- Check network latency simulation settings
- Ensure Redis is running for room state
- Verify WebSocket message delivery

#### Performance Issues
- Reduce number of concurrent players
- Run tests in headless mode
- Use faster machine or CI environment
